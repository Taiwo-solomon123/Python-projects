<!--------------------------------HANGMAN--------------------------->
<!----Functions---->
==> Hanging_man: it takes trials as an index to print the hanging_man drawing at every trial
==> Play: This is where all of the operations take place
==> secret_word: This returns the secret_word and will be assigned to the word variable in the Play Function
==> main Function to run the program


<!---The Play Function--->
==> dashes variable: same length as word
==> trials variable: this is the the number of lifes a user has and it would be passed into the hanging_man function as index.
==> secret_word variable: the secret_word function is assigned
==> guessed_letters variable: to store list of all previously guessed letters
==> guessed_words: to store list of all previously guessed words
==> guessed variable: this will take a False value to indicate that the word has not been guessed... when the word is guessed the value is set to False.
==> While not guessed and trials 6
    ==> Asks the user to guess a word or a char in the secret_word
    ==> if len(guess)==1 and guess.isalpha():
        ==> if guess not in guessed_letters:
            ==> guessed_letters.append(guess)
            ==> if guess in word:
                ==> print("you guessed correctly", guess, "is in the word")
                ==> dashes_as_list=list(dashes)
                ==> indices= [i for i, letter in enumerate(dashes_as_list) if letter==guess]
                ==> for index in indices:
                    ==> dashes_as_list[index]=guess
                ==> dashes=" ".join(dashes_as_list)
                ==> print(dashes)
                ==> if "_" not in dashes:
